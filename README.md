# Welcome!

Here I will be collecting some short & sweet R tutorials! Many of them will build on or remix material from our 2019 course ["Hack Your Data Beautiful"](https://psyteachr.github.io/hack-your-data/).  

If you are new to R & RStudio (the environment that makes R even more fun to use), I recommend this short tutorial: https://psyteachr.github.io/hack-your-data/r_instructions.html. 

If you are wondering what Github is and how it works, I recommend reading this fantastic introduction by Bruna Wundervald & Jo Niec: https://brunaw.com/slides/git-workshop/git-workshop.html#1. 

Happy you are here!
